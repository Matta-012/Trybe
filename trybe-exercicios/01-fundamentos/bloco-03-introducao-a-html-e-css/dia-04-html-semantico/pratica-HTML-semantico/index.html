                    The mantis shrimp lives in warm, shallow water, and typically grows to 
                    be between 6-12 inches (15-30cm) in length. This marvelous creature has not two,
                    not three, not five, but <span>SIXTEEN color-receptive cones</span> and have the
                    most sophisticated vision of <span>ANY PREDATOR ON EARTH</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The rainbow we see stems from just <span>THREE colors</span>, so try to imagine a 
                    mantis rainbow created from <span>SIXTEEN</span> colors. Where we see a rainbow, the mantis
                    shrimp sees a <span>TERMONUCLEAR BOMB of light and beauty</span>.

                <h3>The Undersea Nightmare</h3>                
                <p>
                    Despite being very beautiful, the mantis shrimp is <span>EXTREMELY VIOLENT</span>.
                    It has two raptorial appendages on the front of it's body. These acclerate with
                    the same velocity as a gunshot from a .22 caliber rifle, and in less than
                    three-thousandsths of a second can strike prey with 1,500 Newtons of force!
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>To put this in perspective, if human beings could accelerate our arms at 1/10th
                        that speed, we'd be able to throw a baseball into orbit!
                    </i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Their <s>murder sticks</s> limbs move so quickly the <b>water around them <span>BOILS</span></b>
                    in a process know as <i>supercavitation</i>. When these cavitation bubbles collapse
                    it produces an <b>undersea shockwave</b> that kill prey even if the mantis
                    shrimp misses it's target. The force of these collapsing bubbles also produces temperatures
                    that macthes the <span>THE SURFACE OF THE SUN</span> and emits <i>tiny bursts of light</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using these <s>murder sticks</s> limbs, <span>DESMEMBERMENT</span> is primarily how the
                    mantis shrimp kills it's prey. It bashes other animals into pieces. <br>
                    Aquariums don't tipically house mantis shrimps because they tend to <b>slaughter</b>
                    every other creature they share a tank with and also because they <br>
                    <span>CAN BREAK AQUARIUM GLASS</span>.
